                Geozebra is a project I developed during my final year of high school in collaboration with two classmates.
                It is a clone of the well-known software GeoGebra. Our version is a streamlined, simplified tool designed to visualize function graphs, allowing users to input their own equations. Key features include the ability to adjust graph precision and define function limits. We built this project using MatPlotLib, a specialized Python library for data visualization.
                The user interface was realized using Tkinter, a library that provides a way to create windows, buttons, labels, text boxes, and other GUI components to build interactive applications.

                This is a reverse engineering project I am developing with a colleague for my University Web Development course. It is a Spotify clone currently in its early stages. While it is a work in progress, the goal is to implement full music streaming capabilities (using royalty-free content) and replicate the core user experience of the original platform.
