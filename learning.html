            <p>I graduated in 2023 at the Liceo Scientifico E. Amaldi, Bitetto, with an High school leaving qualification in Applied Science and I'm actually a final year Computer Science student.</p>
            <p>During my 6 years in High School i worked at some projects, but the only one worth a peek is "Geozebra", a GeoGebra clone (more at <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>).</p>
            <p>At the moment I'm working with a colleague of mine, to a Spotify clone, for my Web Development course. I worked to a Recruiting website for my Software Engineering course. Also, I'm about to start a Game Development course and a Cybersecurity course, so i'm planning on building a videogame in the near future and to learn some security system.</p>
